# Scripts

> Bunch of code to do something (eg as trivial as installing VSCode) because I am lazy.  
> Currently, these are just to setup a new Mac with Packages/Git/SSH Access to github etc

## Run

> I sincerely hope none of the scripts will do anything without a user asking the script to. But this will be often updated so no gurantees. Read the code before you run anything  
> If you see some really bad ASCII art, please don't throw a Potato at me, I'm a programmer not MichaelAngelo

- Run Using: `python3 master.py`
- Goto Setup > Config to create a config first
- Github Personal Access Token (PAT) is required only if you want the script to create a SSH Key and add it to your Github Account
    > Github has removed userid-pass based auth so PAT (I'm not an idiot !)
